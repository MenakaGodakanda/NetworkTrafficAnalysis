# Network Traffic Analysis - Version 1

## Features of the project:

### 1. Network Traffic Capture
- Tool Used: tshark
- Live Traffic Capture: The project allows capturing live network traffic on specified network interfaces using tshark.
- Packet Storage: Captured network traffic is saved into a .pcap file for subsequent analysis.

### 2. Network Traffic Analysis
- Tool Used: Zeek
- Log Generation: Analyzes the captured .pcap file to generate detailed logs including conn.log which provides connection summaries.
- Comprehensive Analysis: Extracts a wide range of attributes from network traffic such as timestamps, IP addresses, ports, protocols, byte counts, connection states, and more.

### 3. Anomaly Detection
- Script: analyze_logs.py
- Log Parsing: Parses Zeek's conn.log using pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- Anomaly Filtering: Identifies potential anomalies in the network traffic, such as connections with zero duration.
- Output: Saves the detected anomalies into a CSV file for further inspection and analysis.

### 4. Customizable and Extensible
- Configurable Capture: Users can modify the capture parameters (e.g., network interface, capture filters) to tailor the data collection to specific needs.
- Script Modifications: The analysis script can be extended to include additional filters, anomaly detection mechanisms, or integrate with other data analysis tools.

### 5. User-Friendly Setup and Usage
- Automated Installation: Provides a detailed setup guide with instructions for installing all necessary tools and dependencies.
- Virtual Environment: Uses a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies and ensure compatibility.
- Clear Documentation: Includes a comprehensive README file with step-by-step instructions for setup, usage, and troubleshooting.

### 6. Open Source and Community Driven
- GitHub Repository: The project is hosted on GitHub, encouraging collaboration, improvements, and contributions from the community.
- Open Source Tools: Utilizes open-source tools like tshark, Zeek, and pandas, ensuring transparency and flexibility in how the tools can be used and modified.

### 7. Scalability
- Handles Large Data: Designed to efficiently handle and analyze large volumes of network traffic data.
- Low Memory Usage: Uses pandas with options like low_memory=False to manage large datasets without excessive memory consumption.

### 8. Security and Compliance
- Permissions Management: Ensures that files have the correct permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
- Comment Handling: Ignores comments in log files to prevent parsing errors and focus on actual data.

### Example Use Cases
- Intrusion Detection: Identifying unauthorized access attempts or abnormal traffic patterns indicating potential security breaches.
- Network Monitoring: Continuously monitoring network traffic to detect and respond to issues in real-time.
- Performance Analysis: Analyzing network performance metrics to optimize and troubleshoot network infrastructure.

## Coding Details:

### Python Script (analyze_logs.py)
The analyze_logs.py script is designed to analyze network traffic logs generated by Zeek to detect anomalies such as connections with zero duration. The script processes the connection logs (conn.log), filters out anomalies, and saves the results for further analysis.

#### 1. Import pandas library:
- pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python. It provides data structures like DataFrames which are used for data analysis and manipulation.

#### 2. Define the column names:
- These columns correspond to the fields in Zeek's conn.log. They describe various attributes of network connections such as timestamps, unique IDs, IP addresses, ports, protocols, service types, durations, byte counts, connection states, and packet counts.

#### 3. Load the connection log file:
- This line reads the conn.log file into a DataFrame.
- sep='\t': Specifies that the log file is tab-separated.
- comment='#': Ignores lines starting with # which are comments in Zeek logs.
- na_values='-': Treats - as missing values.
- low_memory=False: Ensures efficient memory usage for large files.
- names=columns: Specifies the column names for the DataFrame.

#### 4. Print the first few rows:
- This prints the first five rows of the DataFrame to verify that the data has been loaded correctly.

#### 5. Print the column names:
- This prints the column names of the DataFrame to ensure that the columns are correctly mapped.

#### 6. Filter for potential anomalies:
- This line filters the DataFrame to find rows where the duration column is zero. A connection with zero duration could indicate an anomaly or an unsuccessful connection attempt.

#### 7. Save the anomalies to a file:
- This saves the filtered anomalies to a CSV file named anomalies.csv in the analysis directory.
- index=False: Ensures that the DataFrame index is not included in the CSV file.

The analyze_logs.py script automates the process of loading, inspecting, and analyzing network traffic logs for anomalies. By using pandas to handle data manipulation, it provides a straightforward and efficient way to identify potential issues in network traffic. This script can be extended or modified to include more sophisticated anomaly detection mechanisms or additional analyses based on different attributes in the logs.
